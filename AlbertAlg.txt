Our overall strategy is to use a bunch of approximation and techniques in order to get the lowest path we can find. I ran greedy twice.


Mine is just a greedy algorithm that guarantees us a solution that follows the constraints of the problem. It searches greedily for the next lowest weight edge from a start node that is already not in the graph. It makes sure that this lowest edge does not break the color constraint of 3 same colors in a row. Furthermore, it keeps track of the remaining colors of red and blues and makes sure theres at least a 1-3 ratio of both, vice versa, so that it never reaches a state where it runs out of a color at the end. In this manner we are able to greedily search a valid route for any graph. We run this twice with different tie breaking mechanisms and pick the lowest route between them.
